# C# OOP Inheritance example

### Inheritance Explained:

- `Inheritance` is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
  It allows `a class` (child or derived class) to `inherit members` (fields, methods, properties, etc.) from another class (parent or base class). 
  This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.

* Members of the base class can have different access levels:
  * `public`: Accessible everywhere.
  * `protected`: Accessible in the base class and its derived classes.
  * `private`: Accessible only within the base class.
  * `internal`: Accessible within the same assembly.

- Types of Inheritance:
  * `Single Inheritance`: A class inherits from one base class.
  * `Multilevel Inheritance`: A class inherits from a derived class.
  * `Hierarchical Inheritance`: Multiple classes inherit from the same base class.
  * `Multiple Inheritance`: Achieved using interfaces (not supported directly in C#).
